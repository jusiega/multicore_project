# sample images that's a nice photo of a beach isn't it

it is not necessary to input .bmp files into the program. I am not really sure what formats can be handled by the used libraries but .jpg and .bmp are definitely in this noble company. The outputs however need to be kept as .bmp if there are no modifications to the code to be made, or rather will always be .bmp no matter the format specified when passing input. I think. never tried it.

that picture is actually not the most fortunate pick as exhibited in the report which pehaps was caused by a need to make a very quick selection.
