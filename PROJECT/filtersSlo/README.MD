# very slow

the more basic version of the program. a thing that was not attempted was to check if calculating the same index 3 times which occurs thorough this program has any rammifications on the performance. to be honest I have no clue.

change the extension to .cpp and compile with g++ to have a useless program which may be run on any computer.
